Bookstan Ontology
This repository contains the RDF/XML file for the ontology developed for the 8th edition of the Bookstan International Literary Festival, held in Sarajevo in 2023.

Description
The ontology models key entities such as events, participants (authors, curators, moderators), programs, sessions, and locations.
It was developed to support digital archiving, improve access to structured data, and ensure semantic interoperability for the preservation of the festival as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s intangible cultural heritage.

The ontology was created using Protégé software, based on Schema.org classes and properties, with custom extensions.
It includes 15 classes, 36 object properties, 5 data properties, and 237 instances.
